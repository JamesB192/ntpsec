# Simplest possible refclock configuration for sites with a GPS primary source.

# Uses the shared-memory driver, accepting fixes from a running gpsd
# instance watching one PPS-capable GPS. Accepts in-band GPS time (not
# very good, likely to have jitter in the 100s of milliseconds) on one
# unit, and PPS time (almost certainly good to 1 ms or less) on
# another.  Prefers the latter.
