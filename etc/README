= README file for directory conf =

This directory contains example run-time configuration files for the
NTP daemon, and some example startup scripts for launching it.

The *.conf files illustrate some of the more obscure configuration
options you may run into. They are not likely to do anything good if
run on machines other than their native spot, so don't just blindly
copy something and put it up.  Also, they have been modified a bit to
track changes in configuration options, notably the elimination of the
'requestkey' option associated with mode 7 access.

The rc fules are start/stop scripts for NTP.  They are  intended as models
for distribution packagers.

Additional information can be found in the ./docs directory of the
base directory.
