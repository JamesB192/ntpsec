= TO DO =

== Checklist for a quality first release ==

=== Blocker bugs ===

None right now. (Sep-22 2015)

=== Build system ===

* Document build files.

* Cleanup and separate features in pylib/*

* Add 'snapshot' feature to dump config status into a JSON file for collecting 
  build + platform information

* @ expansion needs to be made to work fully for *.txt.in files. They
  are not yet doing file inclusions properly - for example, in
  sntp/sntp-man.txt.in the @../docs/includes/sntp-body.txt@ is not
  interpreted.

* The doc target should build manual pages. Previous item about @-expansion
  is a prerequisite for this, then the *-man.txt files need to be passed
  through asciidoc to make generated man pages.

* An issue with the install productions as presently written is that
  they're written to install to ${PREFIX}/bin and {PREFIX}/sbin.  This
  is right if we're trying to install a test setup to userspace but wrong
  in the normal case - we want /sbin, not /usr/sbin.

* There's no installation yet for the Perl executables under scripts/, or
  their support library under scripts/lib/.

* The install production needs to warn of stale ntpdc and ntpdate binaries.

* Add support for enabling all conditional checks to ensure none are broken.

* Add support for disabling specific conditional tests to ensure nothing is 
  compiled into the base in a surprising fashion.

* Add monkeypatch for rmdir, rmtree under Windows.


=== Code ===

* Clock stepping should use ANSI clock_settime() when possible, for
  the additional precision.

* We should audit scripts/ and utils/ to see which of those programs
  can be thrown out (some, like util/kern.c, don't even build).  Some
  (such as ntptrace) need to be translated into Python and supported.

* We need a build time option to disable all dangerous operations
  that ntpq can produce.

* Fixup copyright notices.
  See Mark's message of Oct-13th.
  Subject: FLOSS license policy and copyright marking policy
  Note help messages need copyright too.

=== Porting ===

* The ntpd initialization sequence is still full of platform-
specific crud.

** We might be able to eliminate a lot of the Linux runtime
droproot code by using file capabilities.

* Better ANSI/POSIX conformance in MinGW and Visual Studio 2013 might
enable us to get rid of the SYS_WINNT code. Should be tried...

=== Testing ===

* Unit testing.  "make check" needs to run all the unit tests.

* Build testing.  The build/CI farm needs to be fully operational.

* Live testing.  Somebody needs to take the development branch,
build it on a real machines, and live-test it to make sure that
it issues sane corrections and doesn't core-dump or barf.
We need to do that on various platforms.

* We also need to live-test various refclocks.  It would be nice
to test the full matrix of refclock x platform, but that's too
much work.  We should probably test as many refclocks as we can
on at least one platform and test the NMEA, Atom, and SHM drivers
on most platforms.

* We need to live-test leap seconds, both getting them from
a file and getting them from other NTP servers.

* Option testing.  The new, non-autogen option-processing logic
is not yet tested anywhere but in ntpd itself.

* The script tests in scripts/t should be investigated, perhaps
  they are salvageable.

=== Documentation ===

* Write up best current practices on starting ntpd.  If it's already
  there, make it easy to find.

* Write a glossary of Mills-speak.

* Short doc on how to tell your ntpd is running correctly.
  Perhaps lifted from GPSD Time Service HOWTO?

* Run everything through a spell checker.

* docs/ntpdsim.txt and docs/ntpdsim_new.txt need to be merged.

* These manpages have no corresponding material inside docs/.  Is that OK?

  ntpd/ntp.keys.txt
  scripts/calc_tickadj/calc_tickadj.txt
  scripts/summary.txt
  scripts/ntpsweep/ntpsweep.txt
  scripts/plot_summary.txt
  scripts/update-leap/update-leap.txt

* In the docs subdirectory, include/command.txt is an HTML passthrough
  in a not entirely successful attempt to emulate the look of the
  Mills HTML documentation this directory was made from. It should be
  cleaned up or replaced.

* Similarly, includes/footer.txt is a tabular hack made to resemble the
  old HTML and should be cleaned up.

* Do the ntp -> ntps name change.  Note: ntp-keygen -> ntpskeygen,
  and perhaps sntp -> ntpss (so *all* programs have the ntps prefix).

* The format and organization of the NEWS file needs a rethink.

* Phabricator-centered workflow needs to be written up and integrated
  with the website content I wrote for us.

* Website needs to be integrated (with a contacts and services page,
  among other things) and published.

=== Remaining procedural issues ===

* The dev changes need to be fed through through Phabricator,
  reviewed, and if necessary fixed.

* Version-numbering policy needs to be decided and written up.  Are
  we going to go with the original 1.x/2.x split?  The website draft
  still assumes this.

* We need a release checklist.

== After beta release ==

* ntpproto.py - a Python library that knows the NTP wire protocol and
  can be used to generate and interpret packets.  Daniel has speculated
  about writing this in order to test possible exploits, but there are
  other uses.

* Deploy ntpproto.py to replace the Perl library under scripts/lib/.  Then
  use that to translate the Perl stuff under scripts/ to Python.

* Hal says "We need a way to inspect/debug bits on the wire. `ntpdate
  -du' is the traditional approach."  Hal's straw man is a new program
  rather than trying to make sntp do this.  Eric's prposed answer:
  ntpshark, a command interpreter written around ntpproto.py and
  loosely modeled on wireshark.

* Bigger game: can a Python front end to ntpproto.py replace sntp?
  Or even ntpq?

* There is a mess around the symbols NO_MAIN_ALLOWED, BUILD_AS_LIB, and
  LIBNTP_C that needs to be refactored.  ntpd should *always* be built as
  a library linked to a main module, these guard symbols should go away.

* seccomp sandboxing fails to build under Ubuntu due to some confusion
  in the Linux headers.  Investigate.

* Should tickadj and ntptime merge? ntpstune, anyone? 

* Adapt BSD snprintb into a better dumper for flag words like flash
  codes (throwing out the old-format support) and use it
  systematically to make reports more readable.

* Timer events need, as much as possible, to be eliminated - they eat
  power on laptops and mobile devices, usually unnecessarily.  At least
  one, the /etc/resolv.conf reload, would be better handled under Linux
  by asynchronous file-change notifications.

* Take another look at SHM.  I think we can make a version that is
  read-only and solid.  Maybe write a support package that does all the
  work if you call it with the date/time.

== Old, sometime ancient stuff ==

970711: Look Real Hard at changing the key stuff from u_long to u_int32.

970711: Make sure it's safe to convert proto_config's 2nd argument from
	u_long to u_int32.  Watch "set" in ntp_request.c:setclr_flags().

970318: in hourly_stats(?), squawk if the magnitude of the drift is,
	say, >400.
