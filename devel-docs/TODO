== Checklist for a quality first release ==

=== Code ===

* -lrt needs to be linked when present, for clock_gettime() wnen glibc < 2.17.

* The u_* types in ntp.h are GCCisms that should be replaced with
POSIX types.

* scripts/ntptrace.in and scriots/ntpsweep.in need to be expanded into the
actual cripts by substituting in @-cookies.  There may be other cases of
this under scripts/.

* The following symbols need to be investigated to determine under what
circumstances configuration should set them.

HAVE_BINTIME
HAVE_CATGETS

HAVE_DNSREGISTRATION
HAVE_DROPROOT

* Relatedly, the ntpd initialization sequence is still full of platform-
specific crud.

=== Testing ===

* Unit testing.  "make check" needs to run all the unit tests.

* Build testing.  The build/CI farm needs to be fully operational.

* Live testing.  Somebody needs to take the development branch,
build it on a real machines, and live-test it to make sure that
it issues sane corrections and doesn't core-dump or barf.
We need to do that on various platforms.  We also need to
live-test various refclocks.

* Option testing.  The new, non-autogen option-processing logic
is not yet tested anywhere but in ntpd itself.

=== Documentation ===

The documentation is a stale, untidy, duplicative mess.

* man pages outside of docs/ need to be paired with the Mills manpages
  inside it, with duplications removed.

* In the docs subdirectory, include/command.txt is an HTML passthrough
  in a not entirely successful attempt to emulate the look of the
  Mills HTML documentation this directory was made from. It should be
  cleaned up ore replaced.

* Similarly, includes/footer.txt is a tabular hack made to resemble the
  old HTML and should be cleaned up.

* A serious content-editing and update pass on the documents is needed.
  Various pieces (such as near --version and exit values) are often lies
  produced by autogen.

* Part of d) is the ntp -> ntps name change.

* The format and organization of the NEWS file needs a rethink.

* Phabricator-centered workflow needs to be written up and integrated
  with the website content I wrote for us.

* Website needs to be integrated (with a contacts and services page,
  among other things) and published.

=== Remaining procedural issues ===

* The dev changes need to be fed through through Phabricator,
reviewed, and if necessary fixed.

* Version-numbering policy needs to be decided and written up.

* We need a release checklist.

== Old, sometime ancient stuff ==

      *** IF YOU CAN HELP FIX ANY OF THESE THINGS, PLEASE DO! ***

010402: Look harder at -lm and -lelf - they are needed less and less...

970711: Look Real Hard at changing the key stuff from u_long to u_int32.

970711: Make sure it's safe to convert proto_config's 2nd argument from
	u_long to u_int32.  Watch "set" in ntp_request.c:setclr_flags().

970318: in hourly_stats(?), squawk if the magnitude of the drift is,
	say, >400.

970301: Implement the utmp/wtmp timestamping on time steps.

970210: Find a way to dump the current configuration to either syslog or
	a file.

Problems that need to be fixed:

- Get rid of the old SYS_* macros:
  (It's worth noting that any code that would have been "enabled" by any
  of these macros has not been used since 5.83, and there have been very
  few complaints...)

  SYS_44BSD:

- config.guess might need help to identify:

  Fujitsu's UXP				--enable-adjtime-is-accurate
					--enable-step-slew

  Unixware				--enable-adjtime-is-accurate
					--enable-tick=10000
					--enable-tickadj=80
					--enable-udp-wildcard
					--disable-step-slew

  DomainOS				--enable-adjtime-is-accurate
					--disable-kmem
					--enable-tick=1000000

  OpenVMS				--enable-slew-always
					--enable-hourly-todr-sync

  Is adjtime accurate on ALL sysv4* machines?
  Can we identify DomainOS with *-apollo-* ?
  Do we catch all Unixware machines with *-univel-sysv* ?

- Combine enable-step-slew and enable-ntpdate-step

- Make sure enable-hourly-todr-sync is always disabled
  What about NextStep and OpenVMS, where hourly TODR sync used to be enabled?

- Check dcfd.c for variables that need to be volatile.
