= README for development documentation =

This directory contains internal and historical documentation of interest to
NTP developers.  Some of the files are:

CommitLog-4.1.0::
	Changes from 1997 to 2001.

ChangeLog::
	Changes from 2001 to mid-2015.  (Temporarily moved back to
	the root directory until we fix the build to not care where
	it lives.)

hacking.txt::
	Notes to folks who want to hack on the code.

dot.emacs::
	C-mode indentation rules for code "Just the way Dave likes it".

TODO::
	List of items the NTP developers are working on.

HISTORIC-README::
	Dave Mills's original README; the ftp location and some other
	things are wrong but it maintains some historical interest.
	Long in the source tree as WHERE-TO-START.

HISTORIC-VERSIONS::
	How to read NTP Classic version numbers.

y2k.txt::
	Notes on Y2K conformance.
