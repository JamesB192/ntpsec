== Reference Clock Addresses ==

Unless noted otherwise, further information about these commands is on
the link:refclock.html[Reference Clock Support] page.

Reference clocks are identified by a syntactically correct but invalid
IP address, in order to distinguish them from ordinary NTP peers. These
addresses are of the form 127.127._t_._u_, where _t_ is an integer
denoting the clock type and _u_ indicates the unit number in the range
0-3. While it may seem overkill, it is in fact sometimes useful to
configure multiple reference clocks of the same type, in which case the
unit numbers must be unique.
