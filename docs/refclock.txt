== Introduction ==

NTP Version 4 supports almost four dozen satellite, radio and telephone
modem reference clocks plus several audio devices for instrumentation
signals. A general description of the reference clock support is on this
page. Additional information about each reference clock driver can be
found via links from this page. Additional information is on the
link:rdebug.html[Debugging Hints for Reference Clock Drivers] and
link:howto.html[How To Write a Reference Clock Driver] pages.
Information on how to support pulse-per-second (PPS) signals produced by
some devices is on the link:pps.html[Pulse-per-second (PPS) Signal
Interfacing] page. All reference clock drivers require that the
reference clock use only Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Timezone and
standard/daylight adjustments are performed by the operating system
kernel.

A reference clock will generally (though not always) be a radio timecode
receiver synchronized to standard time as provided by NIST and USNO in
the US, NRC in Canada and their counterparts elsewhere in the world. A
device driver specific to each reference clock must be compiled in the
distribution; however, most common radio, satellite and telephone modem
clocks are included by default and are activated by configuration
commands.

Reference clocks are supported in the same way as ordinary NTP clients
and use the same filter, select, cluster and combine algorithms. Drivers
have addresses in the form 127.127._t.u_, where _t_ is the driver type
and _u_ is a unit number in the range 0-3 to distinguish multiple
instances of the same driver. The connection to the computer is device
dependent, usually a serial port, parallel port or special bus
peripheral, but some can work directly from an audio codec or sound
card. The particular device is specified by adding a soft link from the
name used by the driver to the particular device name.

The `server` command is used to configure a reference clock. Only the
`mode`, `minpoll`, `maxpoll`, and `prefer` options are supported for
reference clocks, as described on the link:clockopt.html[Reference Clock
Commands] page. The `prefer` option is discussed on the
link:prefer.html[Mitigation Rules and the `prefer` Keyword] page. Some
of these options have meaning only for selected clock drivers.

The `fudge` command can be used to provide additional information for
individual drivers and normally follows immediately after the `server`
command. The reference clock stratum is by default 0, so that the server
stratum appears to clients as 1. The `stratum` option can be used to set
the stratum to any value in the range 0 through 15. The `refid` option
can be used to change the reference identifier, as might in the case
when the driver is disciplined by a pulse-per-second (PPS) source. The
device-dependent `mode`, `time` and `flag` options can provide
additional driver customization.

== Special Considerations ==

The link:audio.html[Audio Drivers] page describes three software drivers
that process audio signals from an audio codec or sound card. One is for
the NIST time and frequency stations WWV and WWVH, another for the
Canadian time and frequency station CHU. These require an external
shortwave radio and antenna. A third is for the generic IRIG signal
produced by some timing devices. Currently, these are supported in
FreeBSD, Solaris and SunOS and likely in other system as well.

The link:driver1.html[Undisciplined Local Clock] driver can
simulate a reference clock when no external synchronization sources are
available. If a server with this driver is connected directly or
indirectly to the public Internet, there is some danger that it can
destabilize other clients. It is not recommended that the local clock
driver be used in this way, as the orphan mode described on the
link:assoc.html[Association Management] page provides a generic backup
capability.

The local clock driver can also be used when an external synchronization
source such as the IEEE 1588 Precision Time Protocol or NIST Lockclock
directly synchronizes the computer time. Further information is on the
link:extern.html[External Clock Discipline and the Local Clock Driver]
page.

Several drivers make use of the pulse-per-second (PPS) signal
discipline, which is part of the generic driver interface, so require no
specific configuration. For those drivers that do not use this
interface, the link:driver22.html[PPS Clock Discipline] driver
can be can provide this function. It normally works in conjunction with
the reference clock that produces the timecode signal, but can work with
another driver or remote server. When PPS kernel features are present,
the driver can redirect the PPS signal to the kernel.

Some drivers depending on longwave or shortwave radio services need to
know the radio propagation time from the transmitter to the receiver.
This must be calculated for each specific receiver location and requires
the geographic coordinates of both the transmitter and receiver. The
transmitter coordinates for various radio services are given in the
http://www.eecis.udel.edu/%7emills/ntp/qth.html[Time and Frequency
Standard Station Information] page. Receiver coordinates can be obtained
locally or from Google Earth. The actual calculations are beyond the
scope of this document.

Depending on interface type, port speed, etc., a reference clock can
have a small residual offset relative to another. To reduce the effects
of jitter when switching from one driver to the another, it is useful to
calibrate the drivers to a common ensemble offset. The
`enable calibrate` configuration command described on the
link:miscopt.html[Miscellaneous Options] page activates a special
feature which automatically calculates a correction factor for each
driver relative to an association designated the prefer peer.

== List of Reference Clock Drivers ==

Following is a list showing the type and title of each driver currently
implemented. The compile-time identifier for each is shown in
parentheses. Click on a selected type for specific description and
configuration documentation, including the clock address, reference ID,
driver ID, device name and serial line speed. For those drivers without
specific documentation, please contact the author listed in the
link:copyright.html[Copyright Notice] page.

If you have seen older versions of NTP, this list may have fewer
entries than you expected.  Support for some very ancient drivers
(notably, those rendered obsolete by the WWVB modulation change in
2013) has been dropped in order to reduce our maintainance load.
