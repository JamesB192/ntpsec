== Synopsis ==

["literal",subs="normal"]
Address: 127.127.33._u_
Reference ID: DUMBCLOCK
Driver ID: DUMBCLOCK
Serial Port: /dev/dumbclock_u_; 9600 bps, 8-bits, no parity
Features: (none)

== Deprecation warning ==

This refclock is deprecated and obsolete. The {project-shortname}
maintainers plan to remove it in a future release.  If you have a
requirement for it, please make this known to us.

== Description ==

This driver supports a dumb ASCII clock that only emits localtime at a
reliable interval. This has no provisions for leap seconds, quality
codes, etc. It assumes output in the local time zone, and that the C
library mktime()/localtime() routines will correctly convert back and
forth between local and UTC.

Most of this code is originally from refclock_wwvb.c (now
refclock_spectracom.c) with thanks. It has been so mangled that wwvb is
not a recognizable ancestor.

---------------------------
Timecode format: hh:mm:ssCL
hh:mm:ss - local time
C - \r (carriage return)
L - \n (newline)
