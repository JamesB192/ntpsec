// Authentication commands - included twice

The following declarations control MAC authentication:

[[controlkey]]
+controlkey+ _key_::
  Specifies the key identifier to use with the
  {ntpqman} utility, which uses the standard protocol defined in
  RFC 5905. The _key_ argument is the key identifier for a trusted key,
  where the value can be in the range 1 to 65,535, inclusive.

[[keys]]
+keys+ _keyfile_::
  Specifies the complete path and location of the key file
  containing the keys and key identifiers used by {ntpdman},
  and {ntpqman} when operating with symmetric-key cryptography.
  This is the same operation as the +-k+ command line option.

[[trustedkey]]
+trustedkey+ _key..._ ::
  Specifies the key identifiers which are trusted for the purposes of
  authenticating peers with symmetric key cryptography, as well as keys
  used by the {ntpqman} program.
  Multiple keys on the same line should be separated by spaces.
  Key ranges can be specified as (first ... last).  The spaces around
  the ... are necessary.  Multiple +trustedkey+ lines are supported
  and trusted keys can also be specified on the command line.

The MAC authentication procedures require that both the local and remote
servers share the same key and key identifier for this purpose,
although different keys can be used with different servers.
The _key_ arguments are 32-bit unsigned integers with values from 1 to
65,535.

The following command controls NTS authentication. It overrides
normal TLS protocol negotiation, which is not usually necessary.

[[nts]]
+nts+ [enable|disable] [+mintls+ _version_] [+maxtls+ _version_] [+tlsciphers+ _name_] [+tlsciphersuites+ _name_]

The options are as follows:

+cert+ _file_::
  Present the certificate in _file_ as our certificate.

+key+ _file_::
  Read the private key to our certificate from _file_.

+ca+ _location_::
  Use the file (or directory) specified by _location_ to
  validate NTS-KE server certificates instead of the system
  default root certificates.

+enable+::
  Enable NTS-KE server.
  When enabled, _cert_ and _key_ are required.

+disable+::
  Disable NTS-KE server.

+mintls+ _string_::
  Set the lowest allowable TLS version to negotiate. Will be useful in
  the wake of a TLS compromise.  Reasonable values are _TLS1.2_ and
  _TLS1.3_ if your system supports it.  1.3 was first supported in
  OpenSSL version 1.1.1.

+maxtls+ _string_::
  Set the highest allowable TLS version to negotiate. By setting
  +mintls+ and +maxtls+ equal, you can force the TLS version for
  testing. Format is as for +mintls+.

// https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/8964/sending-tls-messages-with-out-encryption-using-openssl-code
+tlsciphers+ _string_::
   An OpenSSL cipher list to configure the allowed ciphers for TLS
   versions up to and including TLS 1.2. A single NULL cipher disables
   encryption and use of certificates.

+tlsciphersuites+ _string_::
   An OpenSSL ciphersuite list to configure the allowed ciphersuites for
   TLS 1.3.  A single NULL cipher disables encryption and use of certificates.

+aead+ _string_::
   Specify the crypto algorithm to be used on the wire.  The choices
   come from RFC 5297.  The only options supported are AES_SIV_CMAC_256,
   AES_SIV_CMAC_384, and AES_SIV_CMAC_512.  This slot is dual use.
   It is the server default if the remote client doesn't request a
   valid choice and it is also the preference passed to the
   remote client if the server command doesn't specify a preference.
   The default is AES_SIV_CMAC_256.

The following options of the +server+ command configure NTS.

+nts+::
  Use Network Time Security (NTS) for authentication.  Normally,
  this is all you have to do to activate the client side of NTS.

  The hostname following the +server+ command is used as the address
  of the NTS key exchange server (NTS-KE) rather than the address
  of a NTP server.  The NTS-KE exchange defaults to using the same
  IP Address for the NTP server.

  Note that the server name must match the name on the certificate.
  That is probably a FQDN rather than a short alias that you would
  probably use to talk to an internal server.

+ask+ _address_::
  Use Network Time Security for authentication.  Ask
  for a specific NTS server, which may differ from the NTP server.
  Conforms to RFC 3896 section 3.2.2 prescription for the Host part of
  a URI: that is, the _address_ may be a hostname, an FQDN, an IPv4
  numeric address, or an IPv6 numeric address (in square brackets).
  The address may have the suffix +:port+ to specify a UDP port.

+require+ _address_::
  Use Network Time Security for authentication and encryption.
  Require a specific NTS server, which may differ from the NTP server.
  Address syntax is as for +ask+.

+noval+::
  Do not validate the server certificate.

+expire+::
  How long to use a secured NTP association before rekeying with the
  NTS-KE server.

+cert+ _file_::
  Present the certificate in _file_ as our client certificate,
  overriding the site default.

+ca+ _location_::
  Use the file, or directory, specified by _location_ to validate the
  NTS-KE server certificate, overriding the site default.  Do not use
  any other CA.

+aead+ _string_::
   Specify the prefered crypto algorithm to be used on the wire.
   The only options supported are AES_SIV_CMAC_256, AES_SIV_CMAC_384, and
   AES_SIV_CMAC_512.  The server may ignore the request.  See the _aead_
   option above.


The same _aead_ algorithms are also used to encrypt cookies.
  The default is AES_SIV_CMAC_256.  There is no config file option to
  change it, but you can change it by editing the saved cookie key
  file, probably /var/lib/ntp/nts-keys.  Adjust the _L:_ slot to be
  48 or 64 and adjust the _I:_ slots to have the right number of bytes.
  Then restart the server.  (All old cookies held by clients will be
  rejected so their next 8 NTP requests will be ignored.  They should
  recover by retrying NTS-KE to get fresh cookies.)
