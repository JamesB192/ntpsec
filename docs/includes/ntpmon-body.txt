== Synopsis ==

+ntpmon+ [hostname]

== Description ==

This program is a real-time status monitor for NTP.  It presents the
same information as the 'peers', 'mrulist', 'rv', and 'cv' commands of
{ntpqman}, but using a split-window display that also includes a
status summary bar, and updates at intervals guaranteed to show status
changes almost as soon as they occur.

(Specifically, the display begins updating once per second and
adjusts itself to poll at twice the frequency of the shortest
polling interval reported in the last peers response.)

The status bar includes the version string of the server being
watched, the (local) time at which it was last updated, and the
current query interval.

^C cleanly terminates the program. Any keystroke will trigger a poll
and update. A few single-keystroke commands are also interpreted as
commands.

If no hostname is specified on the command line, localhost is monitored.

== Commands ==

a:: Change peer display to apeers mode, showing association IDs.

d:: Toggle select mode (some peer will be reverse-video highlighted when on).

j:: Select next peer (in select mode); arrow down also works.

k:: Select previous peer (in select mode); arrow up also works.

n:: Toggle display of hostnames (vs. IP addresses).

o:: Change peer display to opeers mode, showing destination address.

p:: Change peer display to default mode, showing refid.

q:: Cleanly terminate the program.

s:: Show all hosts, not just reachable ones.

w:: Toggle wide mode.

x:: Cleanly terminate the program.

<space>:: Rotate through display modes.

?:: List these commands.

When no peer is selected, <space> rotates through a/n/o/p display modes
for the whole peers list. When a peer is selected, <space> toggles
detail-display mode.

== Options ==

-V:: Display version and exit.

== Known Bugs ==

When querying a version of ntpd older than NTPsec 0.9.6, +ntpmon+ will
appear to hang when monitoring hosts with extremely long MRU lists -
in particular, public pool hosts. Correct behavior requires a Mode 6
protocol extension not yet present in those versions.
