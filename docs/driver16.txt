== Synopsis ==

["literal",subs="normal"]
Address: 127.127.16.'u'
Reference ID: BTFP
Driver ID: GPS_BANCOMM
Bancomm Device: /dev/btfp0

== Deprecation warning ==

This refclock is deprecated and obsolete. The {project-shortname}
maintainers plan to remove it in a future release.  If you have a
requirement for it, please make this known to us.

== Description ==

This is the clock driver for Symmetricom bc600 series of Time and
Frequency Processors (formerly sold under the brands Datum and
Bancomm).

It directly supports the bc637PCI-U on FreeBSD, but requires
installation of a Symmetricom proprietary driver under Linux and
Solaris.

It might also support the bc635VME on SunOS 4.x/SunOS 5.x, though
this has not been confirmed since 2003 and {project-shortname} may no
longer build in that environment without modifications.  The bc635VME
use also requires the Symmetricom proprietary driver.
