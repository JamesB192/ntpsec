// Auxilary association commands - included twice 

`broadcastclient`::
  This command enables reception of broadcast server messages to any
  local interface (type b) address. Upon receiving a message for the
  first time, the broadcast client measures the nominal server
  propagation delay using a brief client/server exchange with the
  server, then enters the broadcast client mode, in which it
  synchronizes to succeeding broadcast messages. Note that, in order to
  avoid accidental or malicious disruption in this mode, both the server
  and client should operate using symmetric-key or public-key
  authentication as described on the "Authentication Options" page.

`manycastserver` _address..._::
  This command enables reception of manycast client messages to the
  multicast group address(es) (type m) specified. At least one address
  is required, but the NTP multicast address 224.0.1.1 assigned by the
  IANA should NOT be used, unless specific means are taken to limit the
  span of the reply and avoid a possibly massive implosion at the
  original sender. Note that, in order to avoid accidental or malicious
  disruption in this mode, both the server and client should operate
  using symmetric-key or public-key authentication as described on the
  "Authentication Options" page.

`multicastclient` _address..._::
  This command enables reception of multicast server messages to the
  multicast group address(es) (type m) specified. Upon receiving a
  message for the first time, the multicast client measures the nominal
  server propagation delay using a brief client/server exchange with the
  server, then enters the broadcast client mode, in which it
  synchronizes to succeeding multicast messages. Note that, in order to
  avoid accidental or malicious disruption in this mode, both the server
  and client should operate using symmetric-key or public-key
  authentication as described on the "Authentication Options" page.

`mdnstries` _number_::
  If we are participating in mDNS, after we have synched for the first
  time we attempt to register with the mDNS system. If that registration
  attempt fails, we try again at one minute intervals for up to
  _number_ times. After all, `{ntpd}` may be starting before mDNS. The
  default value for `mdnstries` is 5.
