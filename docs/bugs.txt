If you find or suspect a security related program bug in this
distribution, please send a report to {project-security-list}. Please do not
contact developers directly.

== Non-Security Bug Reporting Procedures ==

If you find or suspect a non-security related program or documentation
bug in this distribution, please send a report to the {project-bugtracker}
at {project-domain}. Bugs reported this way are
immediately forwarded to the developers. Please do not contact the
developers directly.

If you wish to send a report via electronic mail, please remember that
your report will be held until one of our volunteers enters it in
{project-bugengine}. The email address for these reports is
{project-bug-list}. You will need to register at {project-bugsite} to
participate directly in any e-mail discussion regarding your
report. If you don't register and we have questions for you we won't

register on and use our {project-bugengine} instance to report issues.
