Description: 
         NTPsec, as its name implies, is a more secure Network Time Protocol
         suite. Which synchronizes your computers clock with sources on the
         Internet, your intranet or any reference clocks you might have. Our
         goal is to deliver code that can be used with confidence in 
         deployments with the most stringent security, availability, and
         assurance requirements. Towards that end we apply best practices and
         state-of-the art technology in code auditing, verification, and
         testing. We begin with the most important best practice: true open-
         source code review. The NTPsec code is available in a public git 
         repository. One of our goals is to support broader community
         participation.
