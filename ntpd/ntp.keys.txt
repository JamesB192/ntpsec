== NAME ==
ntp.keys - NTP symmetric key file format configuration file

== DESCRIPTION ==

This document describes the format of an NTP symmetric key file. For a
description of the use of this type of file, see the "Authentication
Support" section of the ntp.conf(5) page.

ntpd(8) reads its keys from a file specified using the -k command line
option or the 'keys' statement in the configuration file. While key
number 0 is fixed by the NTP standard (as 56 zero bits) and may not be
changed, one or more keys numbered between 1 and 65534 may be
arbitrarily set in the keys file.

The key file uses the same comment conventions as the configuration
file. Key entries use a fixed format of the form

--------------
keyno type key
--------------

where `keyno` is a positive integer (between 1 and 65534),
`type` is the message digest algorithm, and
`key` is the key itself.

The `key` may be given in a format controlled by the `type` field. The
`type` MD5 is always supported.  If ntpd was built with the OpenSSL
library then any digest library supported by that library may be
specified. However, if compliance with FIPS 140-2 is required the
`type` must be either 'SHA' or 'SHA1'.

What follows are some key types, and corresponding formats:

_MD5_::
  The key is 1 to 16 printable characters terminated by an EOL,
  whitespace, or a _#_ (which is the "start of comment" character).
_SHA_; _SHA1_; _RMD160_::
  The key is a hex-encoded ASCII string of 40 characters, which is
  truncated as necessary.
+
Note that the keys used by the ntpq(8) and ntpdc(8) programs are
checked against passwords requested by the programs and entered by
hand, so it is generally appropriate to specify these keys in ASCII
format.
