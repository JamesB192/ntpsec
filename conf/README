= README file for directory conf =

This directory contains example run-time configuration files for the
NTP daemon. These files illustrate some of the more obscure
configuration options you may run into. They are not likely to do
anything good if run on machines other than their native spot, so
don't just blindly copy something and put it up.  Also, they have
been modified a bit to track changes in configuration options,
notably the elimination of the 'requestkey' option associated
with mode 7 access.

Additional information can be found in the ./docs directory of the
base directory.
