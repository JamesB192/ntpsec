= README file for directory conf =

This directory contains example run-time configuration files for the
NTP daemon. These files illustrate some of the more obscure
configuration options you may run into. They are not likely to do
anything good if run on machines other than their native spot, so
don't just blindly copy something and put it up. Additional
information can be found in the ./docs directory of the base
directory.

Included also are example public key and symmetric key files produced
by the ntp-genkeys program with names prefixed by ntpkey. These are
ordinarily kept in /usr/local/etc and used by the Autokey scheme.
