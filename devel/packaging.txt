== Package parts ==

Some useful components for package bulding can be found in the etc/
subdirectory, including init boot time scripts, systemd unit files,
and boilerplate for default ntpd configuration.

== Platforms without Python ==

Many tools (actually, almost everything except the core daemon itself)
have either been moved from C to Python or are in the process of
translation.  This is an important step for improving maintainability
and reducing attack surface.  However, we know that some platforms
cannot support Python or choose not to include it in their core
configuration.

For these platorms, we recommend using bbfreeze to render the
Python to C which can be compiled and packaged as a normal executable.

You may find that you need to install the package 'patchelf'.
