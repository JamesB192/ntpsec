== Quick way to get NTS working

This is a recipe, useful during the development and
stabilization phase of NTS landing, to get your NTPsec
instance talking with other instances.

This will get dated quite fast, and is neither the best
way to setup, nor the more conformant, but should be enough
to get you up.

=== Get git head
This has been tested with NTPsec_1_1_3-437-g2bb7f8fb9 .
As the NTS implementation continues, this
may no longer work.  YMMV.

=== Ensure you have the right dependencies
You need a very recent version of Openssl, 1.1.1a is known
to work.  Earlier versons may work, depending on
distributions.  You can check with the following:
`openssl version`

=== ntp.conf (you are a client)

Append the keyword `nts` to the end of your `server`
lines.  Do these only for servers that speak NTS.  As of
late March, the following should work:

```
server ntpmon.dcs1.biz nts
server pi3.rellim.com nts
server kong.rellim.com nts
server ntp1.glypnod.com nts
server ntp2.glypnod.com nts
server zoo.weinigel.se:4447 nts
server nts-test.strangled.net:443 nts
server nts3-e.ostfalia.de:443 nts noval
```

Note that these are development machines, so uptime is
poor.   The last three are servers not running NTPsec, which
were available for interop testing during the March 2019
IETF Hackathon.  Note the _noval_ for the last server, this
is because its certificate is not issued by a trusted root.

Restart ntpd, and skip to <<Verification>>, below.

=== ntp.conf (you are a server)
Being an NTS server requires a well-formed SSL cert.  The
easiest way to do this is if your server has a FQDN, using
LetsEncrypt.  Please see the Certbot client site
[[https://certbot.eff.org/]] for instructions.

If you already have an SSL Cert for your server, and you are
serving time using the same FQDN, you can reuse that Cert.

Add the line:
`nts enable`
to your conf file.

Locate the following two files:
* Your Cert Private Key
* Your Cert Public Key, fully chained up

Then add the lines below to your ntp.conf, replacing
with your pathnames.

Example, for my server:

```
nts key /etc/letsencrypt/live/ntpmon.dcs1.biz/privkey.pem
nts cert /etc/letsencrypt/live/ntpmon.dcs1.biz/fullchain.pem
```

Restart your server, and skip to <<Verification>>, below.

=== Verification

Check your log file.  You should see lines like this:

```
2019-03-22T08:06:32 ntpd[12915]: NTSs: starting NTS-KE server listening on port 123

2019-03-22T08:06:34 ntpd[12915]: NTSc: NTS-KE req to pi3.rellim.com took 0.882 sec, OK
```

This is because of the 

`server pi3.rellim.com nts`

line in ntp.conf.  You should see similar stanzas for each server.
The logging prefix *NTSs* is for the NTS Server component, eg
initializing your keys.  The *NTSc* component is for the NTS Client
part, where you are talking to *other* NTS servers.

==== Check with ntpq

The output of ntpq will be slightly different when NTS is in use,
note the `t` column.  Example:

```
root@ntpmon:/var/www/html/ntp# ntpq -p
     remote                                   refid      st t when poll reach   delay   offset   jitter

```

The `t` column shows how many cookies your NTS client is holding for the
appropriate servers.  The number should be close to 8 (the default).

==== Check with ntp variables

Try `ntpq -c nts` . This will show various counters related
to NTS.  This feature is under active development, so the
format might change.  An example:

```
root@ntpmon:/var/www/html/ntp# ntpq -c nts
NTS client sends:            7491
NTS client recvs:            6562
NTS client recvs w error:    0
NTS server recvs:            5591
NTS server recvs w error:    38
NTS server sends:            5553
NTS make cookies:            6392
NTS decode cookies:          4734
NTS decode cookies old:      819
NTS decode cookies too old:  0
NTS decode cookies error:    0
NTS KE probes:               8
NTS KE probes_bad:           0
NTS KE serves:               75
NTS KE serves_bad:           56
```


=== Thanks for the handholding
Much thanks to Hal Murray and Gary Miller, for most of the
stuff above, and talking me through this.
