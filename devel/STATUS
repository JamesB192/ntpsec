It builds on the following systems.  In general there should be no warnings,
but as of the above date, there are a few that haven't been stamped out yet.

  Fedora 22 and 23 on i686 and x86_64
  Debian wheezy and jessie on amd64
  Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS and 15.04 on x86_64
  Raspbian wheezy and jessie on ARM v6 and v7 (Pi and Pi 2)
  Debian wheezy on BeagleBone Black ARM v7

  FreeBSD 9.3 on i386 and 10.1 on amd64


NetBSD needs more work.  The basic ntpd builds and runs.
  NetBSD 6.1.5 and 7.0 on x86_64

Audio doesn't work.  That is used by
  6     IRIG Audio Decoder
  7     Radio CHU Audio Demodulator/Decoder
  util/tg2

Loading libevent2 doesn't work.  That breaks
  ntpdig and one of the tests
Both build ok but don't load at run time.

I haven't found libevent2 for NetBSD 6.1 so ntpdig doesn't build.




The basic parts of ntpd run on all of the above systems.

That are many options we havn't tested yet.
