It builds on the following systems.  In general there should be no warnings,
but as of the above date, there is one we can't easily work around.  Some
compilers will complain about
  comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions
  at ntpd/ntp_io.c:4638

It's known to build cleanly on:
  Fedora 22 and 23 on i686 and x86_64
  Debian wheezy and jessie on amd64
  Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS and 15.04 on x86_64
  Raspbian wheezy and jessie on ARM v6 and v7 (Pi and Pi 2)
  Debian wheezy on BeagleBone Black ARM v7

  FreeBSD 9.3 on i386 and 10.1 on amd64
  NetBSD 6.1.5 and 7.0 on x86_64
    (see the comment about libevent in ../INSTALL)


The basic parts of ntpd run on all of the above systems.

There are many options that we haven't yet tested.

Refclocks known to work on Linux:
  20    NMEA GPS Receiver
  22    PPS Clock Discipline
  26    Hewlett Packard 58503A GPS Receiver
