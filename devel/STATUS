It builds on the following systems.  In general there should be no warnings,
but as of the above date, there is one we can't easily work around.  Some
compilers will complain about
  comparison between signed and unsigned integer expressions
  at ntpd/ntp_io.c:4399

We have reports that it builds cleanly on at least:
  Fedora 23 and 24 (i686, x86_64)
  CentOS 7.2.1511 and 6.8 (x86_64)
  Debian jessie (amd64, i686, arm) and wheezy on amd64
  Ubuntu 14.04.3 LTS and 16.04.1 LTS on x86_64
  Raspbian jessie on ARM v6 and v7 (Pi, Pi 2, and Pi 3)
  Debian wheezy on BeagleBone Black ARM v7

  FreeBSD 10.2 and 9.3 on amd64 and 10.3 on i386
  NetBSD 7.0.1 and 6.1.5 on x86_64 and 7.0.1 on i386
    (see the comment about libevent in ../INSTALL)


The basic parts of ntpd run on all of the above systems.

There are many options that we haven't yet tested.
