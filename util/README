= README file for directory util/ =

This directory contains the sources for the various utility programs.
Not much documentation, alas.  Read the header comments.

audio-pcm.c::
    Probe the capabilities of your sound card.  Assumes the SADA (Sun
    Audio Driver) interface from SunOS/Solaris/OpenSolaris, also
    implemented by *BSD and in the old OSS Linux sound layer.

hist.c::
    This program can be used to calibrate the clock reading jitter of a
    particular CPU and operating system. It first tickles every element
    of an array, in order to force pages into memory, then repeatedly calls
    gettimeofday() and, finally, writes out the time values for later
    analysis. From this you can determine the jitter and if the clock ever
    runs backwards.

kern.c::
   Header comment from deep in the mists of past time says: "This
   program simulates a first-order, type-II phase-lock loop using
   actual code segments from modified kernel distributions for SunOS,
   Ultrix and OSF/1 kernels. These segments do not use any licensed
   code."  Anybody who has a clue *why* it is doing this and what it's
   supposed to be used for should explain it to us, please.

ntptime.c::
    Checks the kernel configuration for the NTP user interface
    syscalls ntp_gettime() and ntp_adjtime().  If present, the current
    timekeeping data are displayed.  If not, a disappointment is
    displayed.  See the kernel page file in the HTML documentation in
    distribution for further details. ntptime will be built if the
    configuration system believes your platform can use it.

propdelay.c::
   Computes high frequency propagation delays, given the
   longitude and latitude of the transmitter and receiver.  Use
   this for WWV/H and CHU.  Don't use it for WWVB (the computation
   is easier for that).

sht.c::
    Test program for shared memory refclock.

tg.c and tg2.c::
    These are tone generators.  They make audio signals that emulate WWV
    or IRIG (-B and -E).  tg runs on Solaris.  tg2 is a clone that runs on
    Linux, FreeBSD, and NetBSD.  Read the source for the fine print.  tg2
    has a help option available via -h.
